# flutter_bukit_vista_assessment

This project is for the Flutter Developer Online Assessment on Bukit Vista. Where I implemented cubit status management to manage data state, and created 5 components: app_bar, back_button, bottom_navigation bar, item_card, shimmer_loading, and text_field.

Here I attach the apk of this project. Thanks
